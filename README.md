# networkbackup
Start of a python code, meant to extract configuration information from network devices. As of now I don't have a Switch or something similar accessable, I'll sort that out soon and the project can continue once I can start testing the code on a real device. I doubt my home-ISP router will respond to the code anyhow, allthough that would be a start
